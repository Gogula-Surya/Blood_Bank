2 DAO (Data Access Object) and DAO Implementation:

These classes are responsible for handling data retrieval and manipulation operations for the respective entities.

3 Repository Package:

This package contains repositories for the entities, which provide methods for database operations.
 
4 Controller Package:

Controllers are responsible for handling HTTP requests from the front-end and coordinating the necessary actions.
Registration Controller: This controller handles user registration, allowing users to input their information into the system.
